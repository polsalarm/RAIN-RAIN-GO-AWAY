# MERRA2 Data Download Scripts

## Using XAMPP for Our Website

This guide explains how to set up and run our website locally using **XAMPP**, a free and open-source cross-platform web server package that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin.

---

### üìÇ Folder Overview

| File / Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `/htdocs/` | Main web directory where our website files go |
| `/htdocs/index.php` | Entry point of the website |
| `/htdocs/config.php` | Configuration file for database connections |
| `/htdocs/assets/` | Static assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.) |
| `/htdocs/includes/` | Reusable PHP modules and scripts |

---

### üß© Prerequisites

#### 1. Install XAMPP
Download and install XAMPP from the official Apache Friends website:  
üîó [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

Choose the version compatible with your operating system:
- **Windows:** `.exe` installer  
- **macOS:** `.dmg` installer  
- **Linux:** `.run` installer

#### 2. Install a Text Editor (Recommended)
Use a modern code editor for easier configuration and PHP editing:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)



### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Run the Website Locally (Recommended)

1. **Start XAMPP Control Panel**
   - Launch **XAMPP Control Panel**
   - Start **Apache** and **MySQL** services

2. **Copy the Website Files**
   Place your website folder inside:
```

C:\xampp\htdocs\

```
Example:
```

C:\xampp\htdocs\our_website\

````

3. **Create the Database**
- Open your browser and go to:  
  üëâ [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
- Click **Databases ‚Üí New**
- Enter a database name (e.g. `our_website_db`)
- Click **Create**

4. **Import the SQL File (if provided)**
- In phpMyAdmin, select your new database
- Go to the **Import** tab
- Choose the `.sql` file from the `database/` folder of the project
- Click **Go**

5. **Configure Database Connection**
- Open `config.php` (or `.env` file, if used)
- Update database credentials:
  ```php
  $servername = "localhost";
  $username = "root";
  $password = "";
  $dbname = "our_website_db";
  ```

6. **Run the Website**
- Open your browser and visit:  
  üëâ [http://localhost/our_website](http://localhost/our_website)

#### Option 2: Access via Custom Port
If Apache is running on a different port (e.g. 8080):  
üëâ [http://localhost:8080/our_website](http://localhost:8080/our_website)

You can change ports in **XAMPP Control Panel ‚Üí Config ‚Üí Apache (httpd.conf)**.


### üîê Security Notes

- **Never expose** your local XAMPP server to the public internet.  
- Keep `config.php` or `.env` files private (add them to `.gitignore`).  
- Use strong MySQL passwords in production environments.  
- For collaboration, share only the project files, not your `xampp` folder.



### üß∞ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|-----------|
| Apache won't start | Stop other services using port 80 (e.g. Skype, IIS), or change Apache port in XAMPP settings |
| MySQL won‚Äôt start | Check if port 3306 is already in use, or delete `ib_logfile*` files in the MySQL data directory |
| Website not loading | Ensure files are in `htdocs/our_website/` and Apache is running |
| Database connection error | Check `config.php` credentials and ensure MySQL is running |

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª For Team Collaboration

Each developer should:
1. Install XAMPP locally.  
2. Clone the project repository into their `htdocs` folder.  
3. Import the database file.  
4. Use their local setup for development.  

Add `database/` and `config.php` to `.gitignore` to prevent sharing sensitive data.



### üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
- Verify Apache and MySQL are running  
- Check database configuration  
- Inspect the browser console for PHP or JS errors  
- Ask the team lead or system admin for help

## MERRA2 Data Download Scripts

This folder contains Python scripts to download MERRA2 data from NASA Earthdata using your team's credentials.

---

### üìÅ Files

- `download_merra2_data.py` - Full-featured download script with error handling and user-friendly interface  
- `simple_download.py` - Simplified version for quick downloads  
- `data/subset_M2I3NPASM_5.12.4_20251005_124626_.txt` - URL list file containing download links  

---

### üß© Prerequisites

#### 1. Install wget
**Windows:**
- Download wget from: [https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/)
- Or install via Chocolatey:
```bash
choco install wget
````

* Or install via Scoop:

  ```bash
  scoop install wget
  ```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install wget
```

**Linux:**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install wget

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install wget
```

#### 2. NASA Earthdata Account

You need a NASA Earthdata account to download the data:

* Register at: [https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new)
* Remember your username and password

---

### üöÄ Usage

#### Option 1: Full-featured script (Recommended)

```bash
python download_merra2_data.py
```

This script will:

* Check if wget is installed
* Prompt for your NASA Earthdata credentials
* Find the URL file automatically
* Create a download directory
* Handle cookies and authentication
* Resume partial downloads
* Provide detailed progress information

#### Option 2: Simple script

```bash
python simple_download.py
```

This is a minimal version that:

* Prompts for credentials
* Downloads files to `downloaded_data` folder
* Basic error handling

---

### üí° What the Original Command Does

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate --load-cookies C:\.urs_cookies --save-cookies C:\.urs_cookies --keep-session-cookies --user=balbarosa31 --ask-password -i subset_M2I3NPASM_5.12.4_20251005_124626_.txt
```

* Downloads files listed in the URL file
* Handles NASA Earthdata authentication
* Saves session cookies for subsequent downloads
* Uses SSL without certificate verification (for compatibility)

---

### üîê Security Notes

* **Never commit credentials** to version control
* The scripts prompt for passwords securely (no echo)
* Cookies are stored in your home directory (`~/.urs_cookies/`)
* Each developer uses their own credentials

---

### üß∞ Troubleshooting

#### "wget not found" error

* Install wget using the instructions above
* Make sure wget is in your system PATH

#### Authentication errors

* Verify your NASA Earthdata credentials
* Check if your account has access to MERRA2 data
* Try logging in manually at [https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/)

#### Network issues

* The full script includes retry logic and timeouts
* You can resume interrupted downloads by running the script again

#### File permissions (Linux/macOS)

```bash
chmod +x download_merra2_data.py
chmod +x simple_download.py
```

3. Run one of the Python scripts with their credentials

The downloaded files will be identical for everyone.
Consider adding `downloaded_data/` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing large data files.
